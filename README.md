# javascript_functions
A collection of Javascript functions I have made to practice.

1. Reverse String - A function which accepts a string as an argument. Ultimately, it returns and logs that same string in reverse. E.g. Hello --> olleH
2. Repeat Strings - A function which accepts a string and a number as its arguments. It repeats the string by the inputted number of times and returns the result in a new string.
